# login-using-php-mysql
A simple login page using php (mysql as database)

We have a dashboard that the user needs to log in or register first to view the dashboard page and there is also an option to log out.
In this project, user information is stored and read in the database.
There is also a file called `install.php` in which the query to enter the admin user is executed.

***import 'db_sample.sql' from db folder OR make a new database with this name***
